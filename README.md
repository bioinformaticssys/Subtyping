#  CODE OF LRSFC
This is a Matlab separate executable program to identify cancer subtypes based on LRSFC: Subtyping Cancer based on Low-Rank
Representation and Similarity Fusion Clustering by Joint Multi-Omics Data. It provide a methodological framework for detecting disease subtypes.

MATLAB Compiler

1. Prerequisites for Deployment  <br>
. Verify the MATLAB Runtime is installed and ensure you have installed version 9.1 (R2016b).   
. If the MATLAB Runtime is not installed, do the following:<br>
   (1) enter <br>
      mcrinstaller<br>
      at MATLAB prompt. The MCRINSTALLER command displays the location of the MATLAB Runtime installer.<br>
   (2) run the MATLAB Runtime installer.<br>
Or download the Windows 64-bit version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2016b from the MathWorks Web site by navigating to

   http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
  
For more information about the MATLAB Runtime and the MATLAB Runtime installer, see  Package and Distribute in the MATLAB Compiler documentation in the MathWorks Documentation Center.    

NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run MCRInstaller. 

2. Files to Deploy and Package<br>
Files to package for Standalone <br>
================================<br>

## Instruction of LRSFC<br>

1. LRSFC.exe is a Matlab separate executable program for the routine of experimental analysis, implementing the LRSFC algorithm.

2. LRSFC is going to run by supplying following parameters: <br>

        (1)	input Folder: the directory locating of the omics data as the input data.
         Its default format is: each row represents features; the each column is a sample of data; the current form of data is : '.mat' . 
        (2)	output Folder: the directory locating of the cluster assignment as the output data. 
        (3)	parameter lambda: lambda values is set between  2^-15 and 2^15.      
        (4) number of clusters: required number of subtypes 

## Demo

*  Dependencies: Matlab R2016b <br>

* The LRSFC.exe is running as follows:  
LRSFC:C:\Users\SYS\Desktop\LRSFC\inputdata C:\Users\SYS\Desktop\LRSFC\outputdata 128 4
